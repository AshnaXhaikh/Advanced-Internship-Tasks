# ⚡ Energy Consumption Time Series Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **forecasting short-term household energy usage** using historical time-based patterns. By applying different forecasting models, we aim to identify consumption trends and provide accurate short-term predictions.

## 🏢 Organization

**DevelopersHub Corporation – Advanced Internship Project (Task 3)**

## 🎯 Objective

* Forecast household energy usage
* Compare the performance of **ARIMA, Prophet, and XGBoost** models
* Visualize predictions vs. actual consumption

## 📂 Dataset

* **Household Power Consumption Dataset**
* Contains detailed household-level energy usage data with timestamped records

## 🛠️ Steps Involved

1. **Parse and Resample** the time series data
2. **Engineer Time-Based Features** (hour of day, weekday/weekend, etc.)
3. Train and evaluate models:

   * ARIMA
   * Prophet
   * XGBoost
4. **Visualize Actual vs. Forecasted** energy usage

## 📊 Models Used

* **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average):** Captures temporal dependencies
* **Prophet:** Handles seasonality and trend-based forecasting
* **XGBoost:** Machine learning model leveraging engineered features

## 📈 Results & Visualization

The models’ forecasts are compared against actual consumption values, and visualizations highlight how well each approach captures time-based energy usage patterns.

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Extend forecasting to **long-term consumption**
* Add **external features** (weather, holidays, events)
* Deploy as an interactive **dashboard/app**
