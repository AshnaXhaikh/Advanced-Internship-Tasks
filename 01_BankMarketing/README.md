#  Bank Marketing Prediction – Internship Project

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on the **Bank Marketing Dataset**. This dataset contains information about customers (demographic, financial, and interaction details). Our goal is to build a machine learning model that helps banks identify potential customers who are more likely to respond positively to marketing campaigns.

## 🛠️ Approach

1. **Data Understanding & Preprocessing**

   * Loaded the **Bank Marketing dataset**.
   * Handled categorical and numerical features using encoding and scaling.
   * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations.

2. **Model Development**

   * Built multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
   * Selected the **best performing model** based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

3. **Evaluation**

   * Evaluated the model using **confusion matrix, classification report, ROC-AUC curve**.
   * Compared different models and selected the best one for prediction.

4. **Model Explainability (XAI)**

   * Used **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the predictions.
   * Explained at least **5 individual predictions** to understand feature contributions.
   * Generated SHAP plots (summary plot, force plot, waterfall plot) to visualize global and local feature importance.

## 📌 Key Features of the Project

* Built an **end-to-end pipeline**: preprocessing → training → evaluation → explanation.
* Explained **model predictions** using SHAP for **5 different customers**.
* Demonstrated how **explainability in AI (XAI)** helps banks make **trustworthy and transparent decisions**.
