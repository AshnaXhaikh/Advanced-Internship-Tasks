## 📌 Project 4 – Loan Default Risk Prediction with Business Cost Optimization

**🎯 Objective**
Predict loan defaults and optimize decision thresholds to minimize financial loss.

**🛠 Approach**

* Preprocessing: imputation, encoding, scaling, and class balancing
* Trained Logistic Regression & **CatBoost** models
* Defined business costs for **False Positives** (risky loan approved) and **False Negatives** (safe loan rejected)
* Optimized thresholds using cost analysis

**✅ Results**

* **CatBoost** delivered the best performance
* Business cost optimization significantly reduced financial losses
* Visualization tools (confusion matrix, cost vs. threshold curves) supported better decision-making
