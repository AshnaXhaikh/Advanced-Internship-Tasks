# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Data Science & AI/ML Engineering Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation**.  
The goal is to apply **unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)** to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their demographic and behavioral data.  
This segmentation helps in identifying patterns and suggesting **personalized marketing strategies** for each cluster.

## 🛠️ Key Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data cleaning and preparation  
   - Statistical insights and visualizations  

2. **Clustering with K-Means**  
   - Optimal number of clusters identified using the Elbow Method  
   - Customers segmented into distinct groups  

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**  
   - Applied **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis) for better visualization  
   - 2D/3D plots of customer clusters  

4. **Marketing Strategy Suggestions**  
   - Business insights derived for each segment  
   - Actionable recommendations for targeted campaigns
